## What is an FTP server?

The file transfer protocol in English or its acronym FTP is a network protocol for the transfer of files between systems connected to a TCP network, based on the client-server architecture. From a client computer you can connect to a server to download files from or to send files, regardless of the operating system used on each computer. Basically an FTP server, is a server in which we can upload files, download files and is often used to share files in the cloud or can also be used to upload files on a web page.
